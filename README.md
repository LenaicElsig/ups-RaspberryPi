Uninterrupted power supply for Raspberry Pi
This project has been developped during a 3-months traineeship in the Hes-so Valais.
The goal was to design a open-source uninterrupted power supply for the Raspberry-Pi, in case of a power failure such
as someone unplugging it. It is made with components easily available online, and can be mounted on a pcb board.
It features : a single cel li-po, a step up 3.7v -> 5v, a battery charger, power indication and reset-shutdown buttons for the Raspberry Pi. It can be directly plugged on the Pi, and only a single power supply is needed.
